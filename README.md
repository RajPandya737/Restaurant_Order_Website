# Restaurant_Order_Website
Super simple website, I liked XML when I did android development so I thought it would be a smooth transition to HTML. 
I was very wrong. 
It is not so bad once you learn it, but it can be tedious at the beginning.

While coming back from moving to university, I got some food and they gave me an estimated time of  35 minutes which was weird because
we order 2 items, and it is not divisible by anothing other then 5. This means each item takes a different time and I thought this was
something I could implement into a very simple text app.

I decided to spice it up by implementing Flask and HTML. Small amounts of scripting and bootstrap used.

Not a serious project, just exposure and experiance.
